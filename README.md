# Project Bundling for Delphi
## Solving the big Delphi productivity issues.

Project Bundles are a way to eliminate the major Delphi productivity and
portability issues.

It is simply an approach to use to increase productivity and developer collaboration 
by defining a set of simple rules to follow when creating a distrubuted version
control repository for delphi Project Groups  (AKA "Delphi Solutions")

To help with this the Project Template included in this repository can automate
the creation and maintenance of you bundle structure.

## The golden rule of Project Bundling

     If you can *_Clone and Compile_* on a clean delphi installation, you have a Project Bundle  

Obviously the correlary of this is that

     If you can't *_Clone and Compile_* on a clean delphi installation, you *dont* have a Project Bundle
